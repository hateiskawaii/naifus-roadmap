## Non-fungible, AI-generated, waiFUs (NAIFU)
#### Toward a non-human created or custodial collectible card game.

##### What is NAIFU?
NAIFU is an experimental collectible card game to see exactly how far we can take AI, blockchain technology, and the Open Web. 
Previously, collectible card games were played with physical trading cards - you could own them, sell them, trade them, and play with them.
The modern digital age has given us great advances in art and digital goods - but at a cost. The popular "lootbox" or "gacha" models have a fundamental problem.
If I buy my favorite character, a card deck that I really like, or special shiny art for my waifu - there's no guarantee it will be there in the future.
Digital goods of this format are almost universally maintained in ownership by the company producing the game. Given the natural comparisons to gambling mechanics,
the fact that game companies are letting their players gamble on goods they don't really own is immoral, dangerous, and abusive. We here at NAIFU seek to change that:
when you are issued a NAIFU - that NAIFU is yours! Yours to keep, yours to sell on the ethereum blockchain, and yours to play with in the official NAIFU card game (or any compatible card game that uses the token data!). The chief aims of NAIFU are:
* NFT provable ownership of collectible cards.
* Full AI generation of card artwork.
* Full AI generation of new card rules.
* Non-custodial ownership of card creation and issuance
* Total resiliency of collectible data.


Of course, this is a tall order - gas fees need to be paid, hosting data on blockchains is prohibitively expensive, and the idea of operating a full AI model on the blockchain is as-of-yet not done.

##### Fully AI-Generated Card Art:

Previous work on automated card generation has been done, see the roborosewater twitter full of AI generated Magic: The Gathering cards: https://twitter.com/roborosewater?lang=en. There is also the CC0/Public domain AI generated anime generator: https://www.gwern.net/Faces#extended-stylegan2-danbooru2019-aydao

The presence of these AI generated cards and artwork lead to the natural implication: Collectible card games built entirely from AI! with ownership enforced by the blockchain. Freedom, Bitcoin, Waifus! The initial card artwork for some cards will be fully generated using public domain models, and some human generated art (particularly for sections of the game that are not covered by the public-domain StyleGAN). 


##### Fully AI-Generated Card Rules:

Most card games are a simple base set of rules with endless cards and variant that change how the game plays, requiring significant design and creation effort.
The Roborosewater bot indicates that it is perfectly possible to produce playable cards in the game rules with an AI. Training such an AI on the card data and eventually producing entirely-human-free new cards is a goal.


##### Total Resiliency

Advances in decentralized hosting technology like IPFS and the Internet Computer (http://www.dfinity.org) can create a system by which no humans can ever stop the creation of new cards, collectibles, and the associated data. 


These are all really big asks and is frankly, decades of work for a small team - but the further we get, the more interesting the project becomes. The phases of development are as follows:

##### Unhinged Waifu Offering and Beta Ruleset (UWU)

The first series of Game Cards that are designed by humans will be launched in a free-for-all NFT token sale with ERC721 metadata APIs residing at api.naifu.cafe.
Game Cards will be released in batches of 10-100, and special cards may be minted. All minted tokens will be for sale by auction directly. "Secret" tokens that users want for themselves for the card game may come later (ex - getting a copy of a card with special user art). Anyone who wants that functionality will have to wait until the features are developed internally.

Target Date: March 7, 2021

##### Game Launch!

The game will be launched as a website/web application with a desktop client on the Eventually(TM) timeframe. Other users of the network are free to launch implementations of the game code as well, with no restrictions. In the meantime, a paper rulebook will be produced and feel free to import cards into Cockatrice or your favorite card-game app.

Target Date: Q4 2021


##### Data Pipelineing for Training:
To train the GANs for generative artwork and rule text - data collection will have to begin on the core game app.

Target Date: TBD 2022

##### AI Model Building and Testing:

All models will have to be trained to provide rulesets, cute art, and new cards

Target Date: Waifus are important, but if we get here we are already succeeding beyond the wildest dreams of the team or their loving waifus.


##### The Great Migration

Migrating all APIs, systems, frontends to resilient and non-human controlled hands that exist on the blockchain so our waifus can live in peace, free of interference from governments, corporations, or any other entity that would seek to do them harm

Target Date: See above.

## Non-fungible, AI-generated, waiFUs (NAIFU)
#### Toward a non-human created or custodial collectible card game.

##### What is NAIFU?
NAIFU is an experimental collectible card game to see exactly how far we can take AI, blockchain technology, and the Open Web. 
Previously, collectible card games were played with physical trading cards - you could own them, sell them, trade them, and play with them.
The modern digital age has given us great advances in art and digital goods - but at a cost. The popular "lootbox" or "gacha" models have a fundamental problem.
If I buy my favorite character, a card deck that I really like, or special shiny art for my waifu - there's no guarantee it will be there in the future.
Digital goods of this format are almost universally maintained in ownership by the company producing the game. Given the natural comparisons to gambling mechanics,
the fact that game companies are letting their players gamble on goods they don't really own is immoral, dangerous, and abusive. We here at NAIFU seek to change that:
when you are issued a NAIFU - that NAIFU is yours! Yours to keep, yours to sell on the ethereum blockchain, and yours to play with in the official NAIFU card game (or any compatible card game that uses the token data!).
